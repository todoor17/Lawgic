# Lawgic
Lawgic is a legal consultation app that uses Flask for backend, React for frontend, and Ollama (integrated with LangChain) for AI-driven legal insights. Users input legal issues, and the app provides relevant Romanian laws and consequences. Docker ensures seamless deployment. It simplifies legal queries with AI-powered, text-to-voice responses.
