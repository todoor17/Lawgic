# Lawgic - where law meets logic
Lawgic (a blend of "law" and "logic") is an AI-powered assistant that uses Ollama, with Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. This is my first React project. Lawgic integrates text-to-speech using the gTTS Python library from Google and speech-to-text using the speech_recognition library.
In the future, I plan to train Ollama using LangChain to enhance Lawgic with AI-driven legal expertise. Users will be able to input legal issues, and the app will provide relevant Romanian laws and potential legal consequences.
